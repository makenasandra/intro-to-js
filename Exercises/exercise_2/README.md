**INT**

Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a new array of only the prime numbers in the original array. 
Print the new array.

## Suggestion ##
Use a for loop to iterate through the array and a nested for loop to check if each number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
