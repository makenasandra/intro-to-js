**INT**

Write a function that takes an object as a parameter and returns a new array of all the property names in the object that have a string value longer than 5 characters. 
Print the new array.

## Suggestion ##
Use a for...in loop to iterate through the properties of the object and a conditional statement to check if each value is a string and is longer than 5 characters.
